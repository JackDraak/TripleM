# Current Development Todos

## Ultra-Enhanced Musical Sophistication Plan

1. [completed] Analyze current wave synthesis limitations and design improvements
2. [completed] Implement morphing wavetable system for rich timbres
3. [completed] Create additive synthesis engine for complex polyharmonics
4. [in_progress] Design multi-scale rhythm evolution system
5. [pending] Implement phrase-aware rhythm generation
6. [pending] Create Euclidean and polyrhythmic pattern generators
7. [pending] Enhance harmonic series manipulation and formant filtering
8. [pending] Implement spectral morphing for evolving timbres
9. [pending] Integrate all enhancements into cohesive mood-specific systems

## Status Notes

- The above todos were designed for the previous discrete mood-based architecture
- User has now clarified the need for unified generators that respond continuously to input value (0.0-1.0)
- Architecture needs to shift from discrete mood systems to continuous interpolation systems
- Next phase: Research BPM targets and document unified generator architecture
